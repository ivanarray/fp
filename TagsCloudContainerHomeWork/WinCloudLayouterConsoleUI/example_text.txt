hen
scientists
discovered
the
highly
mutated
micron
variant
of
the
coronavirus
last
month
it
set
off
an
eerily
familiar
chain
of
events

ealth
experts
held
somber
news
conferences
that
raised
more
questions
than
answers
fficials
imposed
travel
bans
that
very
likely
came
too
late
irus
trackers
filled
in
their
maps
as
the
variant
was
reported
in
country
after
country
nd
the
rest
of
us
waited
with
increasing
unease
to
learn
more
about
the
threat
we
were
facing

he
same
sequence
unfolded
nearly
two
years
ago
when
the
novel
coronavirus
-o-2
was
first
discovered
n
those
early
weeks
of
2020
the
nited
tates
proved
to
be
woefully
unprepared
for
the
challenges
ahead
starting
with
the
most
fundamental
of
tasks:
detecting
the
virus

“e
had
a
delay
of
one
to
two
months
before
we
were
even
able
to
identify
the
presence
of
the
virus”
said
r
harles
hiu
an
infectious
disease
specialist
and
microbiologist
at
the
niversity
of
alifornia
an
rancisco
“nd
by
that
time
it
had
already
circulated
widely
between
multiple
states
and
from
coast
to
coast”

hese
failures
have
been
well-chronicled
and
micron
is
one
more
sign
that
the
current
pandemic
which
has
now
claimed
the
lives
of
nearly
800000
mericans
is
not
over

ut
micron
is
also
a
dress
rehearsal
for
the
next
pandemic
he
work
before
us
now
—
detecting
tracking
and
slowing
the
spread
of
a
health
threat
we
do
not
fully
understand
—
is
the
same
work
that
will
be
required
to
stop
a
future
outbreak
in
its
tracks

he
analogy
is
not
perfect
hen
micron
arrived
scientists
had
already
developed
vaccines
and
treatments
for
the
virus
and
were
on
high
alert
for
new
variants
he
next
pandemic
may
come
with
less
warning

“e
know
that
there
are
pathogens
worse
than
-o-2
that
are
emerging
and
re-emerging
and
waiting
for
their
moment
to
take
off”
said
ick
right
the
chief
executive
of
the
andemic
revention
nstitute
at
the
ockefeller
oundation

micron’s
emergence
is
an
opportunity
to
take
stock
of
both
the
gains
we
have
made
and
the
ways
in
which
we
are
still
falling
short
t
is
also
a
call
to
action:
hatever
progress
we
have
made
is
not
enough

eek
and
you
shall
find
n
any
other
context
it
would
have
been
unremarkable:
n
unday
ov
28
a
an
rancisco
resident
who
had
been
feeling
mildly
ill
took
a
ovid
test
he
next
day
it
came
back
positive

hat
set
off
alarm
bells
however
was
that
the
resident
had
recently
returned
from
outh
frica
where
the
newly
discovered
micron
variant
was
widespread

he
traveler’s
test
sample
was
flagged
for
priority
genomic
sequencing
which
would
reveal
the
precise
genetic
code
of
the
virus
that
had
infected
the
traveler
—
and
whether
it
had
micron’s
telltale
mutations

r
hiu
the
an
rancisco
microbiologist
was
tapped
to
do
the
sequencing
y
6
pm
on
uesday
ov
30
just
a
few
hours
after
r
hiu
first
learned
about
the
sample
it
was
hand-delivered
to
his
lab
packed
in
dry
ice

r
hiu
and
his
colleagues
quickly
got
to
work
lthough
generating
the
full
sequence
takes
hours
the
scientists
chose
to
use
a
technique
known
as
nanopore
sequencing
which
allowed
them
to
analyze
the
results
in
real-time
while
the
process
was
still
underway

“s
the
data
accumulated
we
were
able
to
identify
more
and
more
mutations”
r
hiu
recalled

efore
dawn
he
was
certain:
t
was
micron
the
first
case
found
in
the
nited
tates
ess
than
a
week
had
passed
since
outh
frica
first
publicly
announced
the
existence
of
the
variant

e
cannot
fight
what
we
cannot
see
and
preventing
the
next
pandemic
begins
with
detecting
and
tracking
the
pathogens
that
threaten
us
n
that
regard
at
least
“we’re
extraordinarily
better
off
than
we
were
this
time
last
year”
said
oseph
auver
a
genomic
epidemiologist
at
the
niversity
